# ðŸ“š Daily - Weekly - Monthly Sales Forecasting
## Dataset
In this study, a dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview) is forecasted with daily, weekly and monthly based. 

The forecasting is conducted based on the total sales of the stores rather than on a store-by-store basis.

## Metrics
Three different colab file is created for each forecasting. The metrics of forecasting are R^2, RMSE and MAPE.

## Methods
Various forecasting methods, ranging from simple models to deep learning models are utilized.
Daily, weekly, and monthly forecasts are performed in separate Colab files.
GridSearch is used to determine the optimal results.
The results of the methods will be included as a PDF after the study is completed.
